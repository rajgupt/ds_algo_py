# Chap2: Object Oriented Programming

## Chap2.1: Goals, Principles and patterns

#  SW development has mainly 3 stages:

1. Design
2. Implementation
3. Testing and Debugging

### 1. Design
Class design is mainly done by 3 rule of thumbs but ore techniques can be used.
* Responsility: Divide work into different actors, each with different **responsibility**
* Independence: Define the work for each class (actors) to be as independent as possible (Single Responsiblity Principle)
* Behaviors: Define the behavior carefully and precisely. 

Common tool for developing an initial high-level design for a project is the
use of CRC cards. Class-Responsibility-Collaborator (CRC) cards
